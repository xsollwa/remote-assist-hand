Robotic arm with gripper hand controlled by joystick and pneumatic haptic feedback

## Overview
The **Remote Assist Hand** is a robotic arm that is able to mimic human grip through joystick remotely and a **air-pressure-based haptic feedback**. This project can potentially be applied in scenarios where a sense of touch, precision and grip are important, such as assisting in medical tasks.

Unlike most robotic hands, this ours has **two-way feedback**, meaning that it responds not only to input but also simulates resistance felt by the hand.

## Features
- **Joystick control:** Easy way to operate the hand remotely.
- **Gripping and grabbing**: The arm can be used to grip and grab small things!
- **Pneumatic haptic feedback**: Air-pressure-based system that mimics the resistance from human grip.
- **Potential medical application**: For tasks with small objects requiring fine control.
