**What we did:**
- For our first work day on this project, we focused on brainstorming and research to get a clear picture of what we want to create. We discussed different project ideas that we had, some of which were focused on medical devices because of interest in biomedical engineering. After going through the pros, cons, and what the build process would look like for each concept, we decided to make a robotic hand with haptic feedback. The idea is that the hand could be useful in situations like small-scale surgeries or remote object handling where you need a sense of "touch" or grip resistance.
  
- One challenge we had was figuring out how to successfully achieve a functional haptic feedback system. After doing some research, we decided on trying to implement haptic feedback based on air pressure. The concept seems simple and effective. weâ€™ll use a small tube with that you squeeze with your hand. The more you squeeze it, the more pressure it senses, and the robotic hand will close proportionally to that pressure. We want it tp work both ways. When the robotic hand feels resistance (like from gripping an object), it pushes air back into the tube, which increases the pressure and makes it physically harder to squeeze.
  
- To make the use of the arm easier, we decided to make it remotely controllable, and we are planning to use a joystick or remote control for that (We will make a joystick/controll-pad for robotic hands with XYR controls, airbulb and haptic feedback system for our second Highway project!). Here is one useful article that we read to get an insight on how to build remotely controllable robot arms:

- Here is a useful video that we watched which was also about building robotic arms:

(The robotic arm in this video is pretty big but ours will be smaller)

**What we did:**
- We set up Visual Studio Code Git extension and cloned the project repository to our computers. We did this to make the workflow smoother since we plan to write the C code for our Arduinos in Visual Studio Code.


- We chose the mechanical parts such as the stepper and servo motors to drive the arm based on power requirements. We also chose our microcontroller allowing for Wi-Fi connectivity using an Arduino model for familiarity. Added these components to the Material and Budget file listing their prices and linking to possible vendors.

**What we did:**
-  We met to brainstorm and discuss the physical design of the robotic arm, more specifically the size of the robot, and how the CAD and PCB would look like. We came up with a design that would be slightly smaller than real human arm because of the strength and size of the motors we are planning to use.
  
-  We began sketching out the CAD design on paper, dimensioning out the arms and making sure our servos can support the torque provided by the weight of the arm. This should allow for easier CADing in the future and smooth operation of the arm.

**What we did:**
- We continued to add to the Materials and Budget list allowing us to shape out the details of the claw itself as we found components needed for the pressure feedback such as a load cell and amplifier. Now having the components needed for the arm we plan on moving onto finding the components for the controller and fully CADing out the arm.
  
- We also had the meeting with Alex to discuss our project and progress. He suggested using an ESP32 microcontroller instead of the Arduino Nano, as it may be more cost-effective and have better WiFi capabilities, so that is what we will move forward with.

- Today I created the first detailed drawing of our robotic arm design. The goal was to visualise how each component would physically fit together; it includes labeling of all of the parts that will go into building the arm (servo motors M1-M4, stepper motor Mst, gripper, load cell L1, amplifier A1, ESP32, MPX5010DP with its tube, and LiPo battery). Here is the first sketch!

- After sharing the design with Philip we discussed how feasible it is and how the pressure feedback system should work. Originally I drew in MPX5010DP with a tube to register pressure, but we ended up coming up with a better way. We agreed to measure haptic feedback electrically through a load cell L1 which measures the amount of bending force applied by the gripper. So, I revised my drawing to its second version by removing the air pressure tube with the MPX5010DP sensor , and included a pressure display on the arm to show live force readings using the load cell. Here is the revised version of the sketch:
