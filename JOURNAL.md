**What we did:**
- For our first work day on this project, we focused on brainstorming and research to get a clear picture of what we want to create. We discussed different project ideas that we had, some of which were focused on medical devices because of interest in biomedical engineering. After going through the pros, cons, and what the build process would look like for each concept, we decided to make a robotic hand with haptic feedback. The idea is that the hand could be useful in situations like small-scale surgeries or remote object handling where you need a sense of "touch" or grip resistance.
  
- One challenge we had was figuring out how to successfully achieve a functional haptic feedback system. After doing some research, we decided on trying to implement haptic feedback based on air pressure. The concept seems simple and effective. weâ€™ll use a small tube with that you squeeze with your hand. The more you squeeze it, the more pressure it senses, and the robotic hand will close proportionally to that pressure. We want it tp work both ways. When the robotic hand feels resistance (like from gripping an object), it pushes air back into the tube, which increases the pressure and makes it physically harder to squeeze.
  
- To make the use of the arm easier, we decided to make it remotely controllable, and we are planning to use a joystick or remote control for that (We will make a joystick/controll-pad for robotic hands with XYR controls, airbulb and haptic feedback system for our second Highway project!). Here is one useful article that we read to get an insight on how to build remotely controllable robot arms:

- Here is a useful video that we watched which was also about building robotic arms:

(The robotic arm in this video is pretty big but ours will be smaller) 

### June 3, 2025 - 4 hours

**What we did:**
- We set up Visual Studio Code Git extension and cloned the project repository to our computers. We did this to make the workflow smoother since we plan to write the C code for our Arduinos in Visual Studio Code.


- We chose the mechanical parts such as the stepper and servo motors to drive the arm based on power requirements. We also chose our microcontroller allowing for Wi-Fi connectivity using an Arduino model for familiarity. Added these components to the Material and Budget file listing their prices and linking to possible vendors.

### June 4, 2025 - 1 hours

**What we did:**
-  We met to brainstorm and discuss the physical design of the robotic arm, more specifically the size of the robot, and how the CAD and PCB would look like. We came up with a design that would be slightly smaller than real human arm because of the strength and size of the motors we are planning to use.
  
-  We began sketching out the CAD design on paper, dimensioning out the arms and making sure our servos can support the torque provided by the weight of the arm. This should allow for easier CADing in the future and smooth operation of the arm.

### June 5, 2025 - 2 hours

**What we did:**
- We continued to add to the Materials and Budget list allowing us to shape out the details of the claw itself as we found components needed for the pressure feedback such as a load cell and amplifier. Now having the components needed for the arm we plan on moving onto finding the components for the controller and fully CADing out the arm.
  
- We also had the meeting with Alex to discuss our project and progress. He suggested using an ESP32 microcontroller instead of the Arduino Nano, as it may be more cost-effective and have better WiFi capabilities, so that is what we will move forward with.

**What we did**

*Ruzanna*
- Today I created the first detailed drawing of our robotic arm design. The goal was to visualise how each component would physically fit together; it includes labeling of all of the parts that will go into building the arm (servo motors M1-M4, stepper motor Mst, gripper, load cell L1, amplifier A1, ESP32, MPX5010DP with its tube, and LiPo battery). Here is the first sketch!

- After sharing the design with Philip we discussed how feasible it is and how the pressure feedback system should work. Originally I drew in MPX5010DP with a tube to register pressure, but we ended up coming up with a better way. We agreed to measure haptic feedback electrically through a load cell L1 which measures the amount of bending force applied by the gripper. So, I revised my drawing to its second version by removing the air pressure tube with the MPX5010DP sensor , and included a pressure display on the arm to show live force readings using the load cell. Here is the revised version of the sketch:

**What we did**

*Philip*
- Today, I worked on fleshing out many of the ideas Ruzanna and I had previously discussed by CADing out some of the significant parts of the arm. I started by importing models of the stepper and servo motors we would be using, then CADing out the load cell as well as the Hex adapter, which would allow for 360-degree rotation. Next, I designed the stationary base, as well as the component for storing various electronics, including the PCB and stepper motor. These parts are denoted by the color blue, as we will 3D print them to construct the arm.

- Tomorrow, I plan to create the PCB design for the arm, which will enable me to scale the arm more effectively and continue refining the current parts that I will be printing. I am attaching images of my CAD progress thus far.

- The top image shows the stationary base, while the bottom represents the electronics casing, which will sit on top of it, supported by the hex adapter and stepper motor shaft.

- I also conitnued to form on the BOM and will be adding these updates tomorrow as I finish CADing.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- Today, I continued working on the CAD, mainly changing the base so that the legs can be printed separately from the base center. This change was to allow for the printing of these parts, as the combined model would not have fit on my 3D printer otherwise. Additionally, this will enable me to scale them to larger sizes if needed. Below is a picture of the new parts.

- The bulk of my work today was spent on KiCAD. Today was my first time using the software. Thus, I spent a considerable amount of time learning how to use it. However, I was able to create my wiring diagram and start my actual PCB design. Below is a picture of my complete wiring diagram.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- I continued to refine my wiring diagram in KiCAD. I was able to complete both tasks, fully optimizing the PCB design for the smallest size while ensuring all the proper electrical connections were made. A part of this design process that took me a while to figure out was creating different nets, which I used to make the connections between my battery and other high-power connections thicker and make those connections as short as possible to reduce voltage drop. Below are pictures of both my complete wiring diagram and PCB design.

- Next, I imported the 3D model of my PCB into OnShape. I refined my Electrical Casing Design, as well as the base, to allow for the proper amount of space to fit all the electrical components. This resizing included the base center to accommodate the new, enlarged size. Below is an image of the new casing.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- I continued working on the Electronics Case, notably adding a panel to access the ESP32 while the lid was screwed on, allowing for easy programming. Additionally, I added a hole for a switch that will enable me to turn off the power from outside the case, even when the lid is screwed on, which protects my programming device from high voltage. Next, I added the lid to hold both the first servo motor and allow for wiring to exit the arm. It also features an additional hole for a screw and nut, providing extra support for the arm. Below are pictures of the new case, panel, and lid.

**What we did**

*Ruzanna*
- Today I completed the [README.md](./README.md) file of this project. In the README I covered the overview of the project, its key features, components, work process, build process and included links to important files such as the MATERIALS-AND-BUDGET.md and JOURNAL.md.
  
- After, I visited the highway website to make sure the project meets submission requirements. I had to make some changes in the README, convert the Bill of Materials to csv format and upload PCB source files. I also ensured that the project repository looks organised.

- Lastly I continued to improve my 3D model. First I found and downloaded the .step files of most of the parts that we are going to use, then imported the electronics into the assembly file and tried to put everything together. It is my first time creating a full assembly using OnShape, so it takes a lot of time. Here is where I am at:

*Philip*
- I shifted my attention to the upper arm area of the robot, CADing out both the male and female halves to ensure the servo motor fit snugly within them. These halves will be held together by M4 screws and threaded inserts and attached to the servo motor. Below are pictures of both of these parts.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- Today, I moved on to what will be the forearm of the robot, once again CADing both the male and female components and finding a suitable location for the servo motor that will power the wrist joint while ensuring the design has sufficient space for any necessary wiring. Below are images of the two parts.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- Today, I designed the wrist joint in CAD, which will hold the 4th and final stepper motor for the claw. This design should not have taken me as long as it did. Still, I was determined not only to ensure the stepper fit well but also to make the design appear polished and sleek while maintaining proper tolerances on these parts and, once again, allowing for room for any wiring. I also made sure to consider how the parts would be installed so that the construction would be easy. Below are images of the two parts of the wrist for both females and males.

**What we did**

*Philip*
- Today was my final day of designing the CAD model; I finished completing the models of the upper and lower claws and finally assembled all the pieces into one. I learned a lot about effective ways to create CAD models of very different shapes, as well as what it means to design a project in CAD from start to finish. While I enjoyed this process, after pouring so many hours into it, I am glad to be done. Below are images of both pieces of the claw as well as the whole assembly.
